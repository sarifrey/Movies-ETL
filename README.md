# Movies-ETL Module 8

## Overview

This project creates an automated pipeline for new data to be tranformed and then loaded into existing tables.

The code was refactored from the Module 8 work to create one function for the three files - Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data.
Then the ETL process is performed and the data added to a PostgreSQL database.
